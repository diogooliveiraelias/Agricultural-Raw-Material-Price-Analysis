This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on agricultural raw material prices over time. 
The analysis focuses on price behavior, percentage variations, correlations, and identifying materials 
with the lowest prices and highest volatility.

# Dataset
The dataset contains historical prices and percentage changes of several agricultural raw materials, including:
- Cotton
- Rubber
- Wool
- Wood products
- Copra
- Hide
- Plywood

# Technologies and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Conversion of date formats
- Correlation analysis between raw material prices
- Price variation (% change) analysis
- Identification of materials with lowest prices over time
- Visualization of trends and volatility
